## UKbiobank-sdMAF-&-sdMISSING-Code
Code used to compute sdMAF for axiom array genotyped, axiom array imputed, and whole exome sequenced data. Only genotyped data were computed using R, while imputed and WES were computed using R based command-line tool developed by our lab. Details of the tool can be found [here](https://github.com/Paterson-Sun-Lab/sdMAF-0.0.3).
